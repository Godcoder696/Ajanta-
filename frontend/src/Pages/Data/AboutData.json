    "para2":"<p>In those days, retailers hardly thought anything about investment and product category. Often got good sales even with a very small product range. But from that time onwards we worked from the counter. Our store in Sirsa was the first counter-functioning fabric retail store </p><br/>",

    "para3":"<p>Three years later, we doubled the size of the store and expanded the product range and variety in fabrics. As far as factors like bill size, turnover, stock rotation are concerned, due to very traditional way of working, we call it a matter of guesswork and experience only. Yes, it was certain guess and experience was never wrong.</p><br/>",
